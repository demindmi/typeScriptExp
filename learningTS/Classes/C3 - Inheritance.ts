  //Because the Person class has a constructor that initializes the firstName and lastName properties, you need to initialize these properties in the constructor of the Employee class by calling its parent classâ€™ constructor.

  //To call the constructor of the parent class in the constructor of the child class, you use the super() syntax. For example:
  // super(firstName, lastName);
  // also NOTE: you need public or private modifiers in the constructor of the child class if you want to access shorthand initialization in the child class.
